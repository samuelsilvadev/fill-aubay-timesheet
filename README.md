### Flags

-   `--user`: your personal username to sign in on Aubay's application.
-   `--pass`: your personal password to sign in on Aubay's application.
-   `--hours-per-day`: if you want to change the default value, which is _8_.
-   `--testing`: use this flag when you want to open the browser and see the
    steps happening, also, it will skip some steps, specifically the following:
    [`saveTimesheet`, `reOpenTimesheet`, `submitTimesheet`]. This flag was added
    to help us test the application without create holes in it üôà
